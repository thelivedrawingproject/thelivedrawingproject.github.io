#### Description

In February, we did an Art residency at the **LabLab**, a well known studio for digital art experimentations in Lyon.  
During three days, we further explored the possibilities of our collaborative drawing technologies for live performance and storytelling. We also explored sound design for our installations.
The residency was concluded by a public live performance.
