After a successful [first edition in 2020](/culturenight), we came back for a second year to celebrate Culture Night. This time we invited Irish and French people to draw on thematics around Europe and the sea.
During the event, 7 illustrators used our performance platform to draw on the walls. Drawing were projected in two locations simultaneously : On the National Gallery of Dublin, and at the Irish Cultural Center in Paris.

The whole event was livestreamed on social medias to let people participate from home.

_We operated the Dublin part of this event remotely from France.
