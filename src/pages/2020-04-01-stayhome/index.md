#### Let's draw together on city walls all over the world!

We decided to adapt our installation so we can exhibit with you during lockdown. **Join the movement** and run _The Live Drawing Project_ from your window with your neigboors to tackle monotony!

**We exhibit every Sunday evening at 9PM. The installation works all over the world.**

#### HOW DOES IT WORK?

Everyone can draw on its phone. The drawings appear instantaneously on the walls! Drawings travel between locations connecting people and creating a **collective artwork**. Would you like to join us next Sunday? To videoproject from your home it's very simple: fill the form and we will contact you:
