#### Description

In April, we made an Art Collaboration with the French street artist **Shab** for his last exhibition at the **Superposition Gallery**.

We presented a collaborative drawing installation entirely based on Shab's visual style. Shab performed alone and in collaboration with the public using our collaborative tools.
