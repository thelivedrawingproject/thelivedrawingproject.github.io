#### Description

In April, we made an Art Collaboration with the French street artist __Shab__ for his last exhibition at the __Superposition Gallery__.  

We presented a collaborative drawing installation entirely based on Shab's visual style. Shab performed alone and in collaboration with the public using our collaborative tools.
